Term Project



CaribResort is an all-inclusive hotel on the north coast in Jamaica. The manager in the hotel wants to keep track of the daily frequency that any specific drink is ordered. If a guest has on an orange armband, he/she is over 18 years of age can order any drink, otherwise the guest is under 18 and cannot order alcoholic drinks. All armbands contain a small RFID tag that indicates the type. When a guest orders a drink, the order goes to the bartender and the drink will be taken to the guest seated at the bar.

Drink Order Module

The guest should be able to order a drink or multiple drinks from the electronic menu at the table he or she is seated at (recall the armband rule). When the bartender receives the order he should changed the status from open to served.
Drink Management Module
The manager should be able to add, modify or remove a drink from the system.


Reporting Module


The manager should be able to pull up the report for all drinks for a particular day or between user-specified periods.
Entity Design


Design your database diagram and class diagram that you will use to model your database which is due week 2 for approval.

*HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT*

The project requires that a database named ap-project be setup. Using a wamp, lamp, or mamp stack such as xampp visit localhost/phpmyadmin after turning on php and mysql from the xampp control panel. While in phpmyadmin click on sql then copy the scripts inside the scripts in the sql file located at db/ap-project-UPDATED DB-.sql. Paste the copied sql script inside the sql window in phpmyadmin then click "GO". This should create the database and do all the necessary initial inserts required for the project to run. Run the clien and then the server or vice versa.
